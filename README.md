### **Key Changes & Game Mechanics Explanation**  

In this **Memory Match Game**, I implemented **dynamic time management**, where every correct match **adds 2 extra seconds** ⏳ to encourage strategic gameplay. The **Game Over & Win screens** now display **separate GIFs** 🎉💀 to enhance user experience. Smooth **card flipping animations** and **sound effects** 🎵 provide an engaging interaction, while the **countdown timer with a warning effect** ⏰ makes the game more challenging.  

The game features **multiple categories** 🃏, including **Fruits, Animals, Emojis, and Planets**, making each round unique. The UI is designed with **glowing neon effects**, and all game elements are optimized for **responsiveness across devices** 📱💻. This project allowed me to strengthen my **JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling** while adding an exciting **interactive gameplay experience!** 🚀🎮
