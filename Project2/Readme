Key Changes & Game Mechanics Explanation
In this Memory Match Game, I implemented dynamic time management, where every correct match adds 2 extra seconds ⏳ to encourage strategic gameplay. The Game Over & Win screens now display separate GIFs 🎉💀 to enhance user experience. Smooth card flipping animations and sound effects 🎵 provide an engaging interaction, while the countdown timer with a warning effect ⏰ makes the game more challenging.

The game features multiple categories 🃏, including Fruits, Animals, Emojis, and Planets, making each round unique. The UI is designed with glowing neon effects, and all game elements are optimized for responsiveness across devices 📱💻. This project allowed me to strengthen my JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling while adding an exciting interactive gameplay experience! 🚀🎮
